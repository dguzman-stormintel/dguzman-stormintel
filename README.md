## **About**

An accomplished **environmental compliance professional** and **AI systems developer** with over seven years of experience in stormwater treatment, remediation, and hazardous waste management for federally regulated projects.
Bridging **field operations**, **regulatory compliance**, and **applied AI**, I develop autonomous systems that integrate machine learning, geospatial visualization, and compliance automation.

As founder of the **Stormwater Intelligence Program**, I design and deploy solutions that use AI to modernize environmental compliance, enhance documentation accuracy, and improve real-time decision-making.

My approach is shaped by extensive **field-based environmental exploration**, including more than fifty documented hikes across California and the western United States. These expeditions provided firsthand exposure to watershed behavior, terrain dynamics, and runoff systems—insights that directly inform my technical and analytical work in stormwater intelligence and geospatial modeling.

## **Hiking & Environmental Exploration**

[![AllTrails](https://img.shields.io/badge/AllTrails-Field_Activity_Log-green?style=for-the-badge\&logo=trailforks\&labelColor=111111)](https://www.alltrails.com/members/daniel-guzman-36/completed)

My environmental expertise is rooted in both professional and personal field experience.
While at the **Santa Susana Field Laboratory**, I founded and led a hiking group of environmental and engineering staff, managing route planning, permits, safety, and logistics.

Over five years, I documented **50+ endurance-level hikes**, including **Mount Whitney**, **Grand Canyon Rim-to-Rim**, and **Half Dome**, across California, Utah, Oregon, and Arizona.
Each expedition was **tracked and verified through AllTrails**, including environmental notes and photos.

These activities often involved **offline navigation and terrain recovery**, strengthening field precision and situational awareness. The hands-on study of watershed behavior, slope runoff, and erosion patterns directly informed my later work in **stormwater modeling** and **AI system design**.

**Field Documentation:**

* Verified Activity Log: [AllTrails Completed Trails](https://www.alltrails.com/members/daniel-guzman-36/completed)
* Photo Record: [AllTrails Photo Feed](https://www.alltrails.com/members/daniel-guzman-36/photos)

## **Field Verification Summary**

From **2020–2025**, I logged over **500 miles of verified hikes** across four states.
This consistent field activity produced a high-resolution understanding of terrain mechanics and watershed response.

**Highlights:**

* 50+ tracked hikes, 4.6★ average rating
* Verified major routes: Mount Whitney, Half Dome, Zion Narrows, Angels Landing, Mount San Antonio, Rim-to-Rim
* Environmental focus: slope runoff, streamflow behavior, soil stability, vegetation response
* Data integration with AllTrails GPS and photographic records

This real-world data has informed the modeling logic behind the **Stormwater Intelligence Program**, closing the loop between **observation, design, and AI-driven analysis**.
